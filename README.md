# Laravel-Challenge-DCC-
A coding challenge received from Dutch Coding Company for me to Finish.

before 10-06-2019, spent some time researching what Laravel exactly is, and installed it and started a project with help of laracasts.

10/06/2019 - Today I took on some lessons on laracast. These were about Controllers, Routing, Views and Models. Also, I created a mysql database. 
As for the current state of the challenge. I have a working button, and changing values for activity, type and amount of participants on button press. I'm still working on getting the rating to work with the stars. Finished for today. I think i spent around 5 hours today, of which some where installing laravel and watching videos before actually starting the project.
